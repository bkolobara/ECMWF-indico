 I created a customization directory called indico-theme in /opt/indico/
 
 and configured the indico.config file at /opt/indico/etc/

```
CUSTOMIZATION_DIR = '/opt/indico/indico-theme'
LOGO_URL = 'https://www.ecmwf.int/sites/all/themes/ecmwf2013/logo.png'
```

I've linked the logo with an absolute URL to ECMWF's because I couldn't get the logo file path working relatively but it is included in this repo, within the static files.
